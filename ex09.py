"""
line 47 calculates interest and monthly saving for a deposit and increment the month counter if the 'current_savings < portion_deposit' condition is met
line 50 and 51 also calculates and updates monthly salary based on semi annual pay raises when each half year's total savings has not met the deposit condition
line 52 checks when the month counter reaches 36; if so, it will run a check whether the portion saved from the salary over 3 years has under or overachieved against the episolon value
line 53 checks if the epsilon condition is not met, it will check whether the savings fell short after 3 years; if so, the portion saved becomes the new low end of the guess
line 56 states an else query where it will state a new high end of the guess; after both checks, the next guess will be calculated as well as the portion saved during 3 years and add 1 step to the total number of steps to determine the ideal saving rate
line 62 print this statement when the starting salary is too low to save the portion_deposit over 3 years
line 65 prints the most ideal saving rate derived from the bisection algorithm
line 66 prints the total amount of steps required to achieve the saving goal if the saving rate is successful over 3 years
